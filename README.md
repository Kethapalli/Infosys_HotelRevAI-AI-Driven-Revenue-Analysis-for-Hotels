## 🛠 Data Transformation Steps

1. Loaded raw CSV into Power BI
2. Cleaned and standardized date formats
3. Created Fact and Dimension tables in Power Query
4. Applied conditional logic:
   - Booking Duration
   - Stay Type (Short / Medium / Long)
   - Room Category (Budget / Standard / Premium)
5. Built relationships in Model View
6. Created DAX measures for KPIs

## 📐 Key Calculated Metrics

- **Occupancy Rate**  
- **ADR (Average Daily Rate)**  
- **RevPAR**  
- **Profit = Total Revenue – Total Cost**  
- **Year-over-Year Revenue Growth**  
- **Booking Cancellation Rate**

## 🔍 Key Observations

- Seasonal demand significantly impacts occupancy and ADR
- OTA bookings increase volume but reduce margins
- Repeat guests contribute higher lifetime value
- Promotions increase occupancy but may reduce ADR
- External factors (weather, local events) strongly influence demand
